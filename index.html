        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> We are team of dynamic and professional counsellors. We realized that expats living in Budapest might not have the
            same level of well-being management/ life-coaching / counseling as they have at home. Since we are trained to
            do exactly that AND we speak foreign languages fluently, we hope that we can be of service to those who want
            to feel confident, and balanced and to whom need support in managing their emotional well-being. We provide counseling
            and coaching in several languages for expats and non-natives living within the greater Budapest area. We are
            here to listen to you when you are in need. Our goal is to make you ready and fit to tackle your own challenges,
            but until then, we are here to provide you support. Although the first step is the hardest, it is the most important
            one. Feel free to contact us and tell us Your Story.</p>

            <strong> Dorottya Tiboldi</strong>
            <br> psychologist and family therapist
            <br> integrative child therapist in formation
        </p>
        <p>I obtained my master’s degree at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in psychology, specialized in clinical psychology.
            Since then I have gained experience in various fields, such as child and adolescent psychiatry and worked in
            consultation centers for children and their parents. Already at university I was fascinated by family therapy,
            an approach that considers the individual as part of its social environment and takes into account patterns and
            family history. After my degree I was trained in family therapy and currently I pursue studies in integrative
            child psychotherapy. The latter one unifies multiple therapeutic approaches and focuses on the values and resources
            of the individual while taking into account emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and physiological aspects. As
            confidence is of high importance in therapy, I do my best to provide a trustful and constructive environment.
            My consultations are open to anyone experiencing a moment of hardship: family and relationship issues, difficulties
            with adaptation, lack of self confidence… My counsellings are addressed to parents and couples, and I also provide
            individual consutations for adults, adolescents and children. For further enquiries feel free to contact me via
            phone or e-mail.
        </p>

            <strong>Csongor Matyi</strong>
            <br> psychologist, researcher, educator
            <br> „No matter how long the storm lasts, the sun always shines behind the clouds.” – Khalil Gibran
            <br>

            <p>As a counsellor my task is to help clients identify their strengths, move beyond challenging situations, and
                face difficult or threatening events. Sometimes an encouraging word does the trick, as listening with empathy
                can be an important step towards resolution. At other times objective advice, removed from emotion, helps.
                There are few hard and fast rules in
                <counselling class="">
            </p>

            <p> But given attention, empathy, acceptance and respect, healing can start. Clients are supported in finding ways
                to connect with their inner strengths – present in each of us – no matter how dark the clouds are which blot
                out the inner light. I am a cognitive research psychologist graduate of ELTE University of Budapest. I constantly
                seek new ways to challenge people’s beliefs in order to help them live a more satisfying life.
                <br> I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

        <p>It is a damn stupid thing that the directions of Budapest metro lines are not referred to as the points of compass
            they are heading, but by names no foreigner would ever understand.
            <br> In contrast to London where it is clearly stated whether a service or platform is Northbound or Southbound,
            tourists and first-timers struggle finding out whether Keleti or Kelenföld is the Northeastbound platform...
